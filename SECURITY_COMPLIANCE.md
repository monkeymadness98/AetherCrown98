# Security & Compliance Documentation

## Overview
AetherCrown98 implements comprehensive security measures and is designed to be GDPR-compliant. This document outlines our security practices and compliance measures.

## üîí Security Features

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement
- All production deployments enforce HTTPS
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers enabled
- TLS 1.2+ required for all connections

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Secure token-based authentication
- 30-minute token expiration (configurable)
- Refresh token rotation
- Implementation: `backend/security.py`

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Roles and permissions:
- **Admin**: Full access including user and organization management
- **Manager**: Read, write, and delete operations
- **User**: Read and write access
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### 3. CSRF Protection
- CSRF tokens generated for all state-changing operations
- Token validation on server-side
- Secure token storage and transmission

### 4. Data Encryption

#### At Rest
- Sensitive fields encrypted using Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- Encrypted fields include:
  - Payment information
  - Personal identifiable information (PII)
  - API keys and secrets
  - Authentication credentials

#### In Transit
- TLS/SSL for all API communications
- Encrypted WebSocket connections
- Secure cookie transmission (HttpOnly, Secure flags)

### 5. Security Headers
All responses include security headers:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### 6. Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting using Redis
- Default limits:
  - Anonymous users: 10 requests/minute
  - Authenticated users: 100 requests/minute
  - API keys: 1000 requests/minute

### 7. Input Validation
- All inputs sanitized and validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (input escaping)
- CSRF token validation

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning

### Automated Scans
Regular security scans using:

#### Bandit (Python Security Linter)
- Scans Python code for security issues
- Configuration: `.bandit`
- Run: `bash backend/security_scan.sh`

#### Safety (Dependency Checker)
- Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Scans `requirements.txt` against vulnerability database
- Run: `bash backend/security_scan.sh`

### Manual Security Reviews
- Code reviews for all security-critical changes
- Regular penetration testing (recommended quarterly)
- Security audit logs review

## üìã GDPR Compliance

### Data Protection Principles

#### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
- Clear privacy policy
- Transparent data collection practices
- User consent mechanisms

#### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Data collected only for specified purposes
- No secondary use without consent

#### 3. Data Minimization
- Only necessary data collected
- Regular data cleanup procedures

#### 4. Accuracy
- Users can update their information
- Data verification processes

#### 5. Storage Limitation
- Data retention policies defined
- Automatic data deletion after retention period

#### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and audit logs

### User Rights

#### Right to Access
- API endpoint: `GET /api/user/data`
- Users can download all their data
- Response time: Within 30 days

#### Right to Rectification
- API endpoint: `PUT /api/user/profile`
- Users can update their information
- Changes reflected immediately

#### Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)
- API endpoint: `DELETE /api/user/account`
- Complete data deletion within 30 days
- Anonymization of necessary records

#### Right to Data Portability
- API endpoint: `GET /api/user/export`
- Data provided in JSON/CSV format
- Includes all user-generated content

#### Right to Object
- Users can opt-out of marketing
- Users can restrict data processing
- API endpoint: `POST /api/user/preferences`

### Data Processing Records
All data processing activities logged in `audit_log` table:
- User actions
- Data access
- Data modifications
- Data exports
- Data deletions

### Data Breach Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Immediate risk evaluation
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Notification**: 
   - Users notified within 72 hours
   - Supervisory authority notified if required
5. **Remediation**: Fix vulnerabilities
6. **Documentation**: Complete incident report

## üîê API Security

### API Key Management
- Unique API keys per organization
- Keys stored hashed in database
- Rate limiting per key
- Key rotation capability
- Audit trail for key usage

### Organization-Level Security
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Organization-specific API keys
- Subdomain-based access control
- Organization-level permissions

## üìä Monitoring & Auditing

### Audit Logs
Comprehensive audit trail including:
- User authentication events
- Data access and modifications
- Permission changes
- API key usage
- Failed authentication attempts

### Retention: 
- Security logs: 1 year
- Audit logs: 7 years (configurable)
- Access logs: 90 days

### Error Tracking
- Sentry integration for error monitoring
- Real-time alerts for critical errors
- Error reports include context (no sensitive data)

## üö® Incident Response

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Identification**: Monitor and detect incidents
2. **Classification**: Severity assessment
3. **Response**: Execute response procedures
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve
