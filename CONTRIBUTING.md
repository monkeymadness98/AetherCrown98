Thank you for your interest in contributing to AetherCrown98! This autonomous AI-driven business platform welcomes contributions that enhance its self-maintaining capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AetherCrown98.git`

## Development Setup

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Run tests
cd backend
npm test
```

## Code Standards

### Backend (Node.js)

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write tests for new features
- Document complex logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### Frontend (React)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Ensure responsive design
- Test components

### Naming Conventions

- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `dynamic-pricing.js`)
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `DynamicPricingService`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `calculatePrice`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)

## Testing

All new features should include tests:

```javascript
// backend/tests/your-feature.test.js
describe('YourFeature', () => {
  test('should do something', () => {
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
