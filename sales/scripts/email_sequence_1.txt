Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s operations

Hi {{FirstName}},

I noticed [Company Name] is [specific observation about their business - recent growth, hiring, product launch, etc.].

As you scale, are manual processes becoming a bottleneck? I'm seeing this with similar companies in [industry].

Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company Name]'s operations

Hi {{FirstName}},

I know you're busy, so I wanted to share something useful whether we chat or not.

I put together a quick ROI calculator that shows how much time/money you could save by automating just 3 common business processes:

[Link to ROI Calculator]

For reference, companies in [industry] typically save:
• 15-20 hours per week on administrative tasks
• $3-5K monthly on operational costs
• 40% reduction in errors

Takes 2 minutes to see your potential savings.

Interested in discussing what this could look like for [Company Name]?

Reply with "DEMO" and I'll send you times for next week.

Cheers,
[Your Name]


EMAIL 3: Breakup Email (Day 7)
-------------------------------

Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi {{FirstName}},

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing this isn't a priority right now.

Before I close your file, I wanted to ask:

Is it...
A) Bad timing?
B) Already have a solution?
C) Not interested?
D) Should be talking to someone else?

Just reply with a letter and I'll know where things stand.

If I don't hear back, I won't bother you again.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If timing is the issue, when should I circle back?
